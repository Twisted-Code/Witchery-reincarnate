# Witchery-reincarnate
an open source re-creation of Emoniph's Witchery, updated for 1.10

user advised, this is the first model I've ever attempted to make or, as is in this particular case, remake. As such, it is distributed as is, without warranty of ANY KIND, expressed or implied
I am not affiliated with Emoniph, and in fact did not actually get permission to do this (he never responded to my request), but I don't think I really need it since all the code is my own. If he actually does have a problem with this, he is welcome to speak up and say so, though I can't promise I won't go ahead anyway since, again, it's my own code.
